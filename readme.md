# ScamBlock/Suspicious Action Blocker

## Introduction
Welcome to ScamBlock!  This is a free and open source tool available for both consumer and enterprise use.  When an application that scammers commonly use is opened, it alerts the user that the activity
may not be safe (especially if they were cold-called).  For enterprise use it has the option for branding, buttons that open the company's website or remote support page, as well as an optional password
that would need to be entered prior to continuing past the alert.  All of these settings can be exported to an XML that can be kept with the installer for silent installs through SCCM or many RMM tools.

All of the programs that Scam Block blocks are optional; however, we always recommend blocking syskey at a minimum.
